time complexity
### space complexity:how much memory does it need to run this algo
*** auxillary space complexity: is the extra space of temporary space used by an algo.
space com is equal auxillary space com


How to write good code
1. document your assumptions (e.g. asc or deasc in sorting)
2. explain your approach and how you intend to solve the problem
3. provide code comments where applicable (e.g. the arags in your function)
4. explain the big 0 run time complecity of your solution and justify your ansert
5. identify any additional data structure you used and justify why you used them (e.g. why use a swap variable in the selection sorting)
6. only provide your best answer to each part of the question (*** must provide the best answer)

explain the code:
from high level to low level:
1. input output of the method
2. detail structure (e.g. for loop), what they do (e.g. each for loop does sth)

selection sort
## selection sort for stack
1. use two extra stack to implement selection sort
2. how about one extra stack (will be covered later)
